# TwitterCaps

A public archive of tweets/threads as PDFs or screenshots.

Worried about Twitter imploding and losing a decade's worth of national conversation? If so, please consider contributing to TwitterCaps. The goal is to record as much of Twitter as we can, in case you-know-who loses all our data. Sure, we'll never back everything up. But we can preserve the important stuff, like the time that guy ordered too much rice, or the time dril introduced us to the phrase "face God and walk backwards into hell."

# Getting started

The quickest and best preservation method I've found is using a browser extension (Twitter Print Styles for Chrome) that renders threads to PDFs. It doesn't render all the page elements, so I also like to take screenshots when possible, using either a full-page screenshot extension (Full Page Screenshot for Chrome) or native screenshotting (cmd-shift-4 on a Mac). Both Twitter Print Styles and Full Page Screenshot will scroll the thread, but Twitter Print Styles is much more reliable for longer threads. Twitter Print Styles triggers by pressing the extension icon in the Chrome extension bar, so be sure to pin it.

# Adding to the archive

If you'd like to join the TwitterCaps effort, just install a PDF or screenshot extension, clone this, commit new PDFs or screenshots, and push. I don't want anyone to be blocked on me approving a PR. This is like the Library of Alexandria, if it had been dedicated to memes and shitposting. But if you all are dicks about it I will enforce PRs.

# FAQ

## Is this really necessary?

I hope not! But I work in tech and I know how much labor and knowledge is needed to keep systems running. For example, we already know that [Twitter was in a non-redundant state](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/tech/twitter-data-center-california-heat-wave/index.html) shortly before the takeover. Now that a huge chunk of the institutional knowledge is gone, the prospects for the data are looking bleak.

## Doesn't the Library of Congress archive tweets?

Tweets from 2006 to 2017 are archived by the LoC. [Since 2018, only select tweets have been archived.](https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2017/12/update-on-the-twitter-archive-at-the-library-of-congress-2/) As far as I know, the selection criteria have never been released.

## But we can't really lose Twitter, can we? Like we can't just wake up one day and it's gone?

That's exactly what might happen. Better safe than sorry.
